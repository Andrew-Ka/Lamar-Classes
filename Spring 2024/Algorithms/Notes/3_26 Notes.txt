Last Time: 
Dynamic Pgrming:
	LCS, subsequence
	recursive formula has 3 cases, 
		either 0, 
		they have the sequence, 
		or max of one less of both
	get smaller subproblem, find in table
	know table
	(i,j), i is row, j is column
		(i-1, j) is same column, row above
	DNA ex

Now:
ran thru LCS ex

The Change Problem
	its like the greedy algorithm
	amount of money in least amount of bills
	max benefit, but diff then the others cus we are finding the min
	check highest, if works, then add one and subtract that denomination from the p cents

not bad rly, find min
