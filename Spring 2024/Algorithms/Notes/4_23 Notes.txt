Last Time:

Dijkstra's alg
	don't use neg edges for this, it won't work (correctly)
All pairs shortest path
	based on dynamic pgrm
	have to use adjacency matrix
	Floyd-Warshall Alg
		define smaller subprob: do we need a vertex or naw
		use smaller amount of vertices


Now:

cont.
	recursive formula
		d v(i, j) ^(k)
		if k = 0
			return the weight from i to j
		if k>- 1
			min (d v(i, j) ^(k-1), d v(i, k) ^(k-1) + d v(k, j) ^(k-1))
	consider k is on shortest path
		if yes, then include
			then have to find shortest path from i -> k as well as k -> j
			this is path1 and path2
			subpath of shortest paths are shortest paths
		if no, then don't include
			then shortest path is same without that vertex
this will be on final
