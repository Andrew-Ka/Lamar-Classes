heapsort
quicksort
sort in linear time (need more info tho)

--midterm--

insertion and deletion in binary search tree
Dynamic programming
	0-1 knapsack
	LCS
Greedy Alg
	Huffman Code
	frac money change prob
Graph
	adj list vs matrix
	min spanning tree
		Kruskal vs Prim
	Single src shortest path
		bellman-ford
		negative cycles
	All pairs shortest path
		Floyd Warshall



make sure use successor (left most on right tree, smallest that is bigger) to replace
****will be a deletion question***

**need to know which elements used for knapsack**
*******will be new dynamic programming question***********



***Will be huffman coding question, conceptual why***


*list vs matrix convert to graph and vice versa*
**time complexity and space complexity of the graph stuff**
***BFS and DFS of graph***
	**know the types of edges********will be on test**********
	bfs got shortest path, not using edge weight tho
**Kruskal and Prim**
**negative edges**  vs negative cycles**
***Bellman Ford and Dijkstra**
	Dikstra doesn't work right with negative edges
	bellman ford cycle's is numb of vertices - 1
****floyd warshall alg****
	dynamic pgrming   THIS WILL BE LAST QUESTION ON THE TEST
