think in long term...
very inspirational

HW4
HW2 go over
	1. n=4, use examples
		theta notation (average)
	2. needed more mathy proof
	3. O(nlogn) = leading term


last time:

heapsort alg
	uses build-max-heap fn and max-heap fn
	last node becomes root, then rebuild as max-heap, recursively till in order
	time complexity: O(nlogn), which is same as merge sort
	

This time:
heap sort and merge sort both have O(nlogn)
	for merge sort, u need temporary arrays to hold sub arrays (lots of space)
	heap sort, no need of more space
		by space efficiency, heap sort is better
	
Quicksort
	follow pseudocode given here, there are a lot of diff versions
	worst case is O(n^2), but its efficiency on average is better, O(nlogn)
	divide and conquer, like merge sort
		divide into 2 subarrays
		around middle element, 2 subarrays can have different sizes
		repeat, divide and conquer
		combine, no need, they are in order by the end of it
	partition fn	
	use color for characteristics
		use white to compare
		racism
	make sure u EXCHANGE and not insertion, bc insertion is linear time, but exchange is constant time
*****quick sort will be on the test
