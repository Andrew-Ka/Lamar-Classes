HW 3 due 2day
use n to show k


this time:
max heap stuff
	build max heap fn gives us a starting point for max heap
	it gives us the parent of the last child, recursively goes down when replace
1st make heap -> 2nd max heap -> 3rd heap sort
	did 1 and 2 last time, now its for heap sort

heapsort alg
	input is array -> build max heap
	then for-loop
		length of array down to 2, 
			exchange root with last leaf, so in the array, the last element will be the original root, and then remake max-heap
			this gives us the largest bubbleing out every time
	it just goes down for loop until array is done===sorted
***this will be on the test
max number of elements for h as height is 2^(h+1) - 1
	2^h <= n <= 2^(h+1) -1
[] means largest integer smaller than...
	like [logn] is largest integer smaller than logn
time complexity for heap sort is O(nlogn), which is the same as merge sort
