We got another hw, due on thursday (4/4/24)
3 Q's
	1. Can be done recursively, can be done w/ LCS method, can also use other dynamic pgrming approach (similar to LCS)

my g is dying he needs a break bruh


Last Time:

Greedy
	don't worry abt future steps, just now
	fractional knapsack prob
	


Now:

Second ex of Greedy: Huffman codes
	its seen in image compression, lots of data, even video
	small plug for the class
	String, frequency is diff for each letter in the string
		Ex: 6 letters, use 3 bits
		use frequency * bits needed (add for all the letters and frequencies)
		 = tot space
		this is fixed-
	Lots of space, but there is better way
	better way: higher frequency, lower bits used
		this is called variable-length code
	comparing these two, we got a compression ratio
	
	Use huffman tree to make huffman code to then make it ez to find
	huffman coding, encoding and decoding
Exs
	pseudocode: 
		got a for loop, make a tree
		left and right subtree, adding them, insert
	
	order letters in increasing frequencies (lowest to highest)
	add 2 lowest nodes (first two elements), add their frequencies
	reorder with new frequencies************* (this comes after every merge)
	merge two lowest
	keep going until added all, essentially making a tree
	huffman tree
now huffman code
	start from root
	if go left, then go 0, if right then go 1
	traverse all the way to leaf nodes
greedy bc we select smallest frequency, every iteration
he really is not doing great, he needs a cough drop or smth
did an example together, ez encode -> decode
	make sure u reorder EVERY SINGLE TIME


LAST TOPIC!!!!! 
Graphs
We will learn:
	what a graph is is
	vertex, edge/link (the lines that connect the vertices)
	Gr = (E, V)
	not standard data strucutre, so have to convert it to one
	sometimes, we got directed graphs, only 1 vertices to another, not backwards
	sometimes have weight to them
	have input (Graph), how to show it
	min spanning tree (MST) where weight is minimized
	shortest path
	some application for vision processing: VISION PROCESSING IS A CLASS lol
